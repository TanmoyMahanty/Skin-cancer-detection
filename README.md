# 🧬 Skin Cancer Detection with YOLOv8 🚀🩺

> Detect skin cancer like a pro using deep learning and computer vision!  
> This project uses the **YOLOv8 object detection model** to identify and classify different types of skin cancer from dermatological images.

## 💡 Why This Project?

Skin cancer is among the most common types of cancer worldwide. Early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This AI-powered detection tool aims to:

- 🧠 Enable **automatic classification** of suspicious skin lesions  
- 🎯 Assist dermatologists with a **second-opinion** visual analysis  
- 🧪 Serve as a learning base for **medical AI applications**

This project showcases how **cutting-edge object detection (YOLOv8)** and **Roboflow datasets** can be used to build a practical, data-driven skin health tool — all within a few lines of Python.
